# AI Safety Prototype

This project is a prototype safety layer for autonomous AI agents.

## Features
- Task input
- Risk detection
- Policy gate
- Logging system
- Feedback memory
- Learning loop

## How It Works
1. User submits task
2. System checks risk
3. High-risk tasks are blocked
4. All actions are logged
5. System learns from history

## Goal
Build adaptive safety infrastructure for agentic AI systems.# ai-safety-prototype
 Safety layer for Emergent Risk in Autonomous AI
